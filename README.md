Automatic Attendance System is designed to collect and manage studentâ€™s attendance records from video camera devices installed in a class rooms. Based on the verification of student identification in the video cameras, attendance will be updated in data base. Attendance will be taken in every class for only an interval of 15 minutes time. This works on a timetable which tells when the attendance starts for the particular course. <br>
